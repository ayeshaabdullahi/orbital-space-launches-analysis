<h1> Orbital Sapce Launches Analysis</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The Orbital Space Launches Analysis project involved analyzing historical orbital rocket launch data from 2023â€“2024 using Excel to identify trends in launch frequency, mission type, and participating countries. Key features were extracted and analyzed to uncover patterns that inform strategic understanding of global space activity. Interactive Tableau dashboards, including geospatial mapping of launch sites, were developed to allow stakeholders to explore the data visually. Additionally, an infographic was created in Canva to summarize findings for both technical and non-technical audiences, effectively communicating insights.
